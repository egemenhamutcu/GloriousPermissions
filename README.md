# GloriousPermissions
Android M system permissions pattern making it manageable, readable and reusable

## Attention!
This is not an Android project and will not be builded. It is an example that demonstrates **GloriousPermissions** pattern. You can find more explanation about the pattern in my medium article below:



The pattern aims to handle all permission process in one place and provide a single behavior for Android permissions in entire project. This way will also save a great number of lines in activities and fragments.
